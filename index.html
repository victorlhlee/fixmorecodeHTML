        <p class="poem">
            Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br>
            Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>
            It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?<br>
            Actually, who are you not to be?
        </p>
        <div id-"shine2"></div>
        <p class="poem">
            Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>
            There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br>
            so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
        </p>

        <p class="poem">
            We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br>
            And as we let our own light shine,<br>
            we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.<br>
            As we are liberated from our own fear,<br>
            our presence automatically liberates others.
        </p>

            <li>The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they
            don't have any.</li>

            <li>Actions speak louder than words.</li>
